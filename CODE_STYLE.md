# Coding Style Guidelines

This document summarizes general principles for writing clear and maintainable code in this repository.

1. **Readability First** - Prioritize clarity over cleverness. Use whitespace and indentation to structure code logically.
2. **Use Descriptive Names** - Choose variable and function names that reveal intent. Avoid abbreviations unless widely understood.
3. **Keep Functions Small** - Limit functions to a single responsibility. Break complex tasks into smaller helpers when possible.
4. **Document Behavior** - Write docstrings for public modules, classes, and functions. Include inline comments for non-obvious logic.
5. **Handle Errors Gracefully** - Use exceptions to signal errors and provide helpful messages. Validate inputs early.
6. **Follow Established Conventions** - Adhere to PEP 8 for Python code style, including naming rules and line length.
7. **Write Tests** - Cover new features with unit tests and keep existing tests passing.
8. **Review and Refactor** - Regularly revisit code to simplify and improve. Remove unused code and fix warnings.

Following these guidelines will help ensure the codebase stays consistent and easy to maintain.
