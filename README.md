# PCB Generator Repository

This repository contains the **BoardForge** project, a Python based PCB generator.

Log files such as `boardforge.log` may appear when running the demos.

Example scripts in the `examples/` folder demonstrate advanced usage such as
the `arduino_like.py` microcontroller board and the
`buck_boost_converter.py` power module with display and buttons.
The repository also adapts several of
[James Bowman's CuFlow project](https://github.com/jamesbowman/cuflow)
examples. Currently `cuflow_demo.py` and `cuflow_clockpwr.py` are available.
The `examples/dazzler.py` script merges the various CuFlow Dazzler demos into
a single comprehensive example. These scripts translate the original CuFlow
commands into BoardForge's higher level PCB API, showing how similar layouts
can be produced while crediting the original CuFlow work.

## Setup scripts

Scripts in the `scripts/` folder help install Python 3 and the required packages.
Run the script that matches your platform from the repository root:

- `scripts/setup_linux.sh` – for Linux distributions using apt, yum, dnf, pacman or zypper
- `scripts/setup_mac.sh` – for macOS using Homebrew
- `scripts/setup_windows.bat` – for Windows using winget or Chocolatey

Each script checks for Python 3 and then installs `requirements.txt`.

## Running the tests

Install the dependencies before running the test suite:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest
```
An optional `requirements-dev.txt` pins the package versions used in CI.
